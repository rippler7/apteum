                        <p>Initially created to provide operational support for our growing businesses, we quickly realised we had a talent acquisition service that could benefit companies across Australia and the world. But rather than follow the traditional approach to outsourcing, we <mark>wanted to build genuine and lasting relationships with the people who support</mark> our business.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>In 2023, we established our own office in Cebu City, where we have <mark>a team of 20+ wonderful people with a wide breadth of skill and specialisation</mark>. Situated on Cebu Island, in South-Central Philippines, Cebu is a vibrant and evolving city. With a population of more than one million, and a median age of 25, this rapidly growing city plays a vital role in the Philippines' emerging economy.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>Our office is based in the Cebu I.T. Park, a district focused on international business that services companies around the world. Due to the professional opportunities available, the area attracts talented people from across the country.  <mark>We couldn't be more pleased to be here</mark>. As our business continues to grow, we remain focused on developing relationships with like-minded clients who align with our values and share our enthusiasm for a more ethical approach to outsourcing.</p>
